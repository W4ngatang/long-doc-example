        The <a href="https://nyu.edu/" target="_blank">New York University (NYU)</a> <a href="https://cds.nyu.edu/" target="_blank"> Center for Data Science</a> is collecting data to enable machines’ to understand and summarize English. Thank you for your help!<br><br>
        You will read a short story or a story excerpt that will take about 20-30 minutes to read. Your task is to (1) create <b>five</b> questions that require summarizing different aspects of the story, and then (2) write answers to those questions. We are especially interested in summaries that <b>draw from multiple parts of the story</b>, if not the entire story, rather than one or two paragraphs from the story.
        <br><br>
        This page shows a detailed example of a text and possible questions and summaries. We give examples of good summaries as well as additional notes to help you perform the task well. The instructions below explain the writing task.<br>

    <h3>Writing Summaries</h3>
    In writing your summary answers, imagine that you are preparing a study guide for this story, e.g. writing a SparkNotes-style answer to the question. Summary answers should be <b>at least 3-5 sentences and a minimum of 75 words (we will check this)</b>. Note that this is a minimum, and some questions may require a longer response, up to a <b>maximum of 500 words</b>. For example, when summarizing what happens to a main character in the story, we've found that summaries are typically around 200-300 words.
    <br><br>

    Your summaries will be evaluated according to the following criteria, and if they meet the criteria, you will be awarded a <strong>bonus payment of $1.50 per accepted summary</strong>. The most important criteria by which summaries will be evaluated are:
    <ol>
        <li><strong>All information presented in your summary is correct and accurate</strong>, i.e. there is no information in your summary that contradicts the story or is not stated in the story, outside of mild interpretation;</li>
        <li> <strong>There are no typos in your summary</strong>;</li> 
        <li><strong>Your summary draws on details from multiple parts of the story</strong>, rather than a single sentence or paragraph.</li>
    </ol>
    <strong>Evaluation and bonus payments will depend largely on these criteria</strong>, so we encourage you to look over your summaries and questions to avoid typos or factual inaccuracies. Additionally, we will evaluate your summary based on whether all essential information is contained in your summary. This criteria is more subjective; we recommend writing in the style of SparkNotes answers. All else equal, summaries should be as detailed as possible while staying inside the word limit.
    <br><br>



    <h3>Creating Questions</h3>
    Our goal is to create and answer questions that require summarizing and drawing details from multiple parts of the story to answer. 
    For example, answering the question of "How does Harry Potter grow over the course of the story?" would require summarizing events from the entire story to answer. 
    To help you in creating questions, we provide a list of question templates below as starting points. 
    <strong>These templates are just suggestions</strong>: While we recommend using a few of them, you should feel free to write your own questions so long as the questions you write can be answered with summaries with the desired properties above. 
    The exception is asking to <strong>summarize the overall plot of the story, which must be answered</strong>. Additionally, not all of the questions will be applicable to every story. 
    For some stories, some questions may be redundant. In both these cases, choose different questions.
    <ul>
        <li><b>What is the plot of the story?</b>: You should always answer this question, this is the default question.</li>
        <li><b>What happens to [character X] throughout the story?</b>: You can use this template multiple times for different characters, and you might also consider variations such as “How does [character X] evolve or grow throughout the story?”. If you use this template, you should focus on characters that feature prominently in the story, rather than appearing in a single paragraph or section. In answering this question, feel free to summarize both character description and actions throughout the story.</li>
        <li><b>What is the relationship between [character X] and [character Y]?</b>: Like the above, you can use this template multiple times for different pairs of characters. However, you should only choose characters that meaningfully interact in the story. You can also consider variants of this template, such as “How are [character X] and [character Y] alike? How are they dissimilar?”. For example, see <a href="https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/1984/study-questions/">the last question here</a>.</li>
        <li><b>Where does the story take place?</b> or <b>Describe the setting of the story</b>: Again, avoid asking this question if answering the question would only draw from a few paragraphs of the story.</li>
        <li><b>What is the significance of [event X] on the rest of the story?</b>: For an example, see <a href="https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/1984/study-questions/">the second question here</a>.</li>
        <li><b>What is the significance of [symbol X]?</b>: You should only answer this question if the significance of a symbol is fairly obvious. We mostly want to avoid relying on reader interpretation of the text and instead focus on what is more or less explicitly stated in the story. For example, consider <a href="https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/1984/study-questions/">the last question here</a>.</li>
        <li><b>How is [theme X] explored throughout the story?</b>: Like the above, you should only answer this question if the themes of the story are fairly obvious and straightforward. Avoid relying on your own interpretation of the story in answering this question. If there are multiple themes, please pick and focus on one theme.</li>
        <li><b>Story-specific questions</b>: For some stories, you may think of unique and interesting questions that you want to ask. You should feel free to ask those questions, so long as the summary answer you would write meets the above criteria. In those cases, feel free to provide and answer those questions. For example, consider <a href="https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/1984/study-questions/">the last question here</a> about the significance of “doublethink” in 1984.</li>
    </ul>

    In writing your questions, make sure to <b>frame each question (and summary) as standalone</b>, i.e. it does not reference or depend on previous questions to be understood.
    <br><br>



    <h3>Reading Passages</h3>
    Given the requirements for writing questions and writing summaries, we recommend <b>reading the story with an eye for details that would be important to include in a summary</b>.<br>

    If you find it helpful to highlight text in the story as you read, you can do so by selecting some text and then pressing the “Highlight” button. You can un-highlight text by selecting the highlighting text, then pressing the “X” button that appears.<br>

    In exceptional circumstances, you can skip the current article by choosing another URL to work on. Only do this if:

    <ul>
        <li>The text is hard to read due to major formatting issues.</li>
        <li>The text is very technical, or a significant amount of extra context is needed to write any question about the passage.</li>
    </ul>

    If you choose to skip a passage, scroll to the bottom of the right panel, give a one-sentence description of why you're skipping the passage, and click on "Skip this passage." You will not be penalized for skipping passages.

  	<h1> Overclocked&mdash;When Sysadmins Ruled the Earth </h1><br>
  	<i> By Cory Doctorow (Originally published in Baen’s Universe, 2006)</i><br><br>  	
  	<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">When Felix’s special
      phone rang at two in the morning, Kelly rolled over and punched him
      in the shoulder and hissed, “Why didn’t you turn that fucking
      thing off before bed?”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Because I’m on
      call,” he said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’re not a
      fucking doctor,” she said, kicking him as he sat on the bed’s
      edge, pulling on the pants he’d left on the floor before turning
      in. “You’re a goddamned <i>systems administrator</i>.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s my job,” he
      said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“They work you like a
      government mule,” she said. “You know I’m right. For Christ’s
      sake, you’re a father now, you can’t go running off in the middle
      of the night every time someone’s porn supply goes down. Don’t
      answer that phone.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew she was right.
      He answered the phone.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Main routers not
      responding. BGP not responding.” The mechanical voice of the
      systems monitor didn’t care if he cursed at it, so he did, and it
      made him feel a little better.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Maybe I can fix it
      from here,” he said. He could login to the UPS for the cage and
      reboot the routers. The UPS was in a different netblock, with its own
      independent routers on their own uninterruptible power-supplies.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Kelly was sitting up in
      bed now, an indistinct shape against the headboard. “In five years
      of marriage, you have never once been able to fix anything from
      here.” This time she was wrong—he fixed stuff from home all the
      time, but he did it discreetly and didn’t make a fuss, so she
      didn’t remember it. And she was right, too—he had logs that
      showed that after 1AM, nothing could ever be fixed without driving
      out to the cage. Law of Infinite Universal Perversity—AKA Felix’s
      Law.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Five minutes later
      Felix was behind the wheel. He hadn’t been able to fix it from
      home. The independent router’s netblock was offline, too. The last
      time that had happened, some dumbfuck construction worker had driven
      a ditch-witch through the main conduit into the data-center and Felix
      had joined a cadre of fifty enraged sysadmins who’d stood atop the
      resulting pit for a week, screaming abuse at the poor bastards who
      labored 24-7 to splice ten thousand wires back together.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">His phone went off
      twice more in the car and he let it override the stereo and play the
      mechanical status reports through the big, bassy speakers of more
      critical network infrastructure offline. Then Kelly called.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hi,” he said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t cringe, I
      can hear the cringe in your voice.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">He smiled
      involuntarily. “Check, no cringing.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I love you, Felix,”
      she said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m totally
      bonkers for you, Kelly. Go back to bed.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“2.0’s awake,”
      she said. The baby had been Beta Test when he was in her womb, and
      when her water broke, he got the call and dashed out of the office,
      shouting, <i>The Gold Master just shipped!</i> They’d started
      calling him 2.0 before he’d finished his first cry. “This little
      bastard was born to suck tit.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m sorry I woke
      you,” he said. He was almost at the data center. No traffic at 2AM.
      He slowed down and pulled over before the entrance to the garage. He
      didn’t want to lose Kelly’s call underground.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s not waking
      me,” she said. “You’ve been there for seven years. You have
      three juniors reporting to you. Give them the phone. You’ve paid
      your dues.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t like
      asking my reports to do anything I wouldn’t do,” he said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve done it,”
      she said. “Please? I hate waking up alone in the night. I miss you
      most at night.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kelly—”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m over being
      angry. I just miss you is all. You give me sweet dreams.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“OK,” he said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Simple as that?”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Exactly. Simple as
      that. Can’t have you having bad dreams, and I’ve paid my dues.
      From now on, I’m only going on night call to cover holidays.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">She laughed. “Sysadmins
      don’t take holidays.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“This one will,” he
      said. “Promise.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’re wonderful,”
      she said. “Oh, gross. 2.0 just dumped core all over my bathrobe.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s my boy,”
      he said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh that he is,”
      she said. She hung up, and he piloted the car into the data-center
      lot, badging in and peeling up a bleary eyelid to let the retinal
      scanner get a good look at his sleep-depped eyeball.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">He stopped at the
      machine to get himself a guarana/medafonil power-bar and a cup of
      lethal robot-coffee in a spill-proof clean-room sippy-cup. He wolfed
      down the bar and sipped the coffee, then let the inner door read his
      hand-geometry and size him up for a moment. It sighed open and gusted
      the airlock’s load of positively pressurized air over him as he
      passed finally to the inner sanctum.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">It was bedlam. The
      cages were designed to let two or three sysadmins maneuver around
      them at a time. Every other inch of cubic space was given over to
      humming racks of servers and routers and drives. Jammed among them
      were no fewer than twenty other sysadmins. It was a regular
      convention of black tee-shirts with inexplicable slogans, bellies
      overlapping belts with phones and multitools.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Normally it was
      practically freezing in the cage, but all those bodies were
      overheating the small, enclosed space. Five or six looked up and
      grimaced when he came through. Two greeted him by name. He threaded
      his belly through the press and the cages, toward the Ardent racks in
      the back of the room.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Felix.” It was
      Van, who wasn’t on call that night.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are you doing
      here?” he asked. “No need for both of us to be wrecked tomorrow.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? Oh. My
      personal box is over there. It went down around 1:30 and I got woken
      up by my process-monitor. I should have called you and told you I was
      coming down—spared you the trip.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Felix’s own server—a
      box he shared with five other friends—was in a rack one floor down.
      He wondered if it was offline too.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s the story?”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Massive flashworm
      attack. Some jackass with a zero-day exploit has got every Windows
      box on the net running Monte Carlo probes on every IP block,
      including IPv6. The big Ciscos all run administrative interfaces over
      v6, and they all fall over if they get more than ten simultaneous
      probes, which means that just about every interchange has gone down.
      DNS is screwy, too—like maybe someone poisoned the zone transfer
      last night. Oh, and there’s an email and IM component that sends
      pretty lifelike messages to everyone in your address book, barfing up
      Eliza-dialog that keys off of your logged email and messages to get
      you to open a Trojan.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Jesus.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yeah.” Van was a
      type-two sysadmin, over six feet tall, long pony-tail, bobbing Adam’s
      apple. Over his toast-rack chest, his tee said CHOOSE YOUR WEAPON and
      featured a row of polyhedral RPG dice.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Felix was a type-one
      admin, with an extra seventy or eighty pounds all around the middle,
      and a neat but full beard that he wore over his extra chins. His tee
      said HELLO CTHULHU and featured a cute, mouthless, Hello-Kitty-style
      Cthulhu. They’d known each other for fifteen years, having met on
      Usenet, then f2f at Toronto Freenet beer-sessions, a Star Trek
      convention or two, and eventually Felix had hired Van to work under
      him at Ardent. Van was reliable and methodical. Trained as an
      electrical engineer, he kept a procession of spiral notebooks filled
      with the details of every step he’d ever taken, with time and date.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not even PEBKAC this
      time,” Van said. Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair. Email
      trojans fell into that category—if people were smart enough not to
      open suspect attachments, email trojans would be a thing of the past.
      But worms that ate Cisco routers weren’t a problem with the
      lusers—they were the fault of incompetent engineers.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, it’s
      Microsoft’s fault,” Felix said. “Any time I’m at work at 2AM,
      it’s either PEBKAC or Microsloth.”</p><br><br>
      <hr style="width:50%"><p></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">They ended up just
      unplugging the frigging routers from the Internet. Not Felix, of
      course, though he was itching to do it and get them rebooted after
      shutting down their IPv6 interfaces. It was done by a couple
      bull-goose Bastard Operators From Hell who had to turn two keys at
      once to get access to their cage—like guards in a Minuteman silo.
      95 percent of the long distance traffic in Canada went through this
      building. It had <i>better</i> security than most Minuteman silos.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Felix and Van got the
      Ardent boxes back online one at a time. They were being pounded by
      worm-probes—putting the routers back online just exposed the
      downstream cages to the attack. Every box on the Internet was
      drowning in worms, or creating worm-attacks, or both. Felix managed
      to get through to NIST and Bugtraq after about a hundred timeouts,
      and download some kernel patches that should reduce the load the
      worms put on the machines in his care. It was 10AM, and he was hungry
      enough to eat the ass out of a dead bear, but he recompiled his
      kernels and brought the machines back online. Van’s long fingers
      flew over the administrative keyboard, his tongue protruding as he
      ran load-stats on each one.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I had two hundred
      days of uptime on Greedo,” Van said. Greedo was the oldest server
      in the rack, from the days when they’d named the boxes after Star
      Wars characters. Now they were all named after Smurfs, and they were
      running out of Smurfs and had started in on McDonaldland characters,
      starting with Van’s laptop, Mayor McCheese.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greedo will rise
      again,” Felix said. “I’ve got a 486 downstairs with over five
      years of uptime. It’s going to break my heart to reboot it.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“What the everlasting
      shit do you use a 486 for?”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing. But who
      shuts down a machine with five years uptime? That’s like
      euthanizing your grandmother.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wanna eat,” Van
      said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tell you what,”
      Felix said. “We’ll get your box up, then mine, then I’ll take
      you to the Lakeview Lunch for breakfast pizzas and you can have the
      rest of the day off.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’re on,” Van
      said. “Man, you’re too good to us grunts. You should keep us in a
      pit and beat us like all the other bosses. It’s all we deserve.”</p><br><br>
      <hr style="width:50%"><p></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s your phone,”
      Van said. Felix extracted himself from the guts of the 486, which had
      refused to power up at all. He had cadged a spare power-supply from
      some guys who ran a spam operation and was trying to get it fitted.
      He let Van hand him the phone, which had fallen off his belt while he
      was twisting to get at the back of the machine.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hey, Kel,” he
      said. There was an odd, snuffling noise in the background. Static,
      maybe? 2.0 splashing in the bath? “Kelly?”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">The line went dead. He
      tried to call back, but didn’t get anything—no ring nor
      voicemail. His phone finally timed out and said NETWORK ERROR.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dammit,” he said,
      mildly. He clipped the phone to his belt. Kelly wanted to know when
      he was coming home, or wanted him to pick something up for the
      family. She’d leave voicemail.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">He was testing the
      power-supply when his phone rang again. He snatched it up and
      answered it. “Kelly, hey, what’s up?” He worked to keep
      anything like irritation out of his voice. He felt guilty:
      technically speaking, he had discharged his obligations to Ardent
      Financial LLC once the Ardent servers were back online. The past
      three hours had been purely personal—even if he planned on billing
      them to the company.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">There was sobbing on
      the line.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kelly?” He felt
      the blood draining from his face and his toes were numb.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Felix,” she said,
      barely comprehensible through the sobbing. “He’s dead, oh Jesus,
      he’s dead.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who? <i>Who</i>,
      Kelly?”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Will,” she said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><i>Will?</i> he
      thought. <i>Who the fuck is—</i>He dropped to his knees. William
      was the name they’d written on the birth certificate, though they’d
      called him 2.0 all along. Felix made an anguished sound, like a sick
      bark.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m sick,” she
      said, “I can’t even stand anymore. Oh, Felix. I love you so
      much.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kelly? What’s
      going on?”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, everyone—”
      she said. “Only two channels left on the tube. Christ, Felix, it
      looks like dawn of the dead out the window—” He heard her retch.
      The phone started to break up, washing her puke-noises back like an
      echoplex.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stay there, Kelly,”
      he shouted as the line died. He punched 911, but the phone went
      NETWORK ERROR again as soon as he hit SEND.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">He grabbed Mayor
      McCheese from Van and plugged it into the 486’s network cable and
      launched Firefox off the command line and googled for the Metro
      Police site. Quickly, but not frantically, he searched for an online
      contact form. Felix didn’t lose his head, ever. He solved problems
      and freaking out didn’t solve problems.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">He located an online
      form and wrote out the details of his conversation with Kelly like he
      was filing a bug report, his fingers fast, his description complete,
      and then he hit SUBMIT.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Van had read over his
      shoulder. “Felix—” he began.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“God,” Felix said.
      He was sitting on the floor of the cage and he slowly pulled himself
      upright. Van took the laptop and tried some news sites, but they were
      all timing out. Impossible to say if it was because something
      terrible was happening or because the network was limping under the
      superworm.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to get home,”
      Felix said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll drive you,”
      Van said. “You can keep calling your wife.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">They made their way to
      the elevators. One of the building’s few windows was there, a
      thick, shielded porthole. They peered through it as they waited for
      the elevator. Not much traffic for a Wednesday. Were there more
      police cars than usual?</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“<i>Oh my God</i>—”
      Van pointed.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">The CN Tower, a giant
      white-elephant needle of a building loomed to the east of them. It
      was askew, like a branch stuck in wet sand. Was it moving? It was. It
      was heeling over, slowly, but gaining speed, falling northeast toward
      the financial district. In a second, it slid over the tipping point
      and crashed down. They felt the shock, then heard it, the whole
      building rocking from the impact. A cloud of dust rose from the
      wreckage, and there was more thunder as the world’s tallest
      freestanding structure crashed through building after building.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Broadcast
      Centre’s coming down,” Van said. It was—the CBC’s towering
      building was collapsing in slow motion. People ran every way, were
      crushed by falling masonry. Seen through the port-hole, it was like
      watching a neat CGI trick downloaded from a file-sharing site.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Sysadmins were
      clustering around them now, jostling to see the destruction.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“What happened?”
      one of them asked.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“The CN Tower fell
      down,” Felix said. He sounded far away in his own ears.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Was it the virus?”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“The worm? What?”
      Felix focused on the guy, who was a young admin with just a little
      type-two flab around the middle.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not the worm,” the
      guy said. “I got an email that the whole city’s quarantined
      because of some virus. Bioweapon, they say.” He handed Felix his
      Blackberry.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Felix was so engrossed
      in the report—purportedly forwarded from Health Canada—that he
      didn’t even notice that all the lights had gone out. Then he did,
      and he pressed the Blackberry back into its owner’s hand, and let
      out one small sob.</p><br><br>
      <hr style="width:50%"><p></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">The generators kicked
      in a minute later. Sysadmins stampeded for the stairs. Felix grabbed
      Van by the arm, pulled him back.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Maybe we should wait
      this out in the cage,” he said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“What about Kelly?”
      Van said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Felix felt like he was
      going to throw up. “We should get into the cage, now.” The cage
      had microparticulate air-filters.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">They ran upstairs to
      the big cage. Felix opened the door and then let it hiss shut behind
      him.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Felix, you need to
      get home—”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s a bioweapon,”
      Felix said. “Superbug. We’ll be OK in here, I think, so long as
      the filters hold out.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get on IRC,” he
      said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">They did. Van had Mayor
      McCheese and Felix used Smurfette. They skipped around the chat
      channels until they found one with some familiar handles.</p>

      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Felix typed, staring at

      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have a soft phone
      on Mayor McCheese,” Van said, launching his voice-over-IP app. “I
      just remembered.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Felix took the laptop
      from him and punched in his home number. It rang once, then there was
      a flat, blatting sound like an ambulance siren in an Italian movie.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Monaco">&gt;
      No phone service</font></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Felix typed again.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">He looked up at Van,
      and saw that his skinny shoulders were shaking. Van said, “Holy
      motherfucking shit. The world is ending.”</p><br><br>
      <hr style="width:50%"><p></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Felix pried himself off
      of IRC an hour later. Atlanta had burned. Manhattan was
      hot—radioactive enough to screw up the webcams looking out over
      Lincoln Plaza. Everyone blamed Islam until it became clear that Mecca
      was a smoking pit and the Saudi Royals had been hanged before their
      palaces.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">His hands were shaking,
      and Van was quietly weeping in the far corner of the cage. He tried
      calling home again, and then the police. It didn’t work any better
      than it had the last 20 times.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">He sshed into his box
      downstairs and grabbed his mail. Spam, spam, spam. More spam.
      Automated messages. There—an urgent message from the intrusion
      detection system in the Ardent cage.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">He opened it and read
      quickly. Someone was crudely, repeatedly probing his routers. It
      didn’t match a worm’s signature, either. He followed the
      traceroute and discovered that the attack had originated in the same
      building as him, a system in a cage one floor below.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">He had procedures for
      this. He portscanned his attacker and found that port 1337 was
      open—1337 was “leet” or “elite” in hacker number/letter
      substitution code. That was the kind of port that a worm left open to
      slither in and out of. He googled known sploits that left a listener
      on port 1337, narrowed this down based on the fingerprinted operating
      system of the compromised server, and then he had it.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">It was an ancient worm,
      one that every box should have been patched against years before. No
      mind. He had the client for it, and he used it to create a root
      account for himself on the box, which he then logged into, and took a
      look around.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">There was one other
      user logged in, “scaredy,” and he checked the proccess monitor
      and saw that scaredy had spawned all the hundreds of processes that
      were probing him and plenty of other boxen.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">He opened a chat:</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Monaco">&gt;
      Stop probing my server</font></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">He expected bluster,
      guilt, denial. He was surprised.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Monaco">&gt;
      Are you in the Front Street data-center?</font></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Monaco">&gt;

      Christ I thought I was the last one alive. I’m on the fourth floor.
      I think there’s a bioweapon attack outside. I don’t want to leave
      the clean room.</font></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Monaco">Felix
      whooshed out a breath.</font></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Monaco">&gt;
      You were probing me to get me to trace back to you?</font></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Monaco">&gt;
      Yeah</font></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Monaco">&gt;
      That was smart</font></p>

      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Monaco">&gt;
      What do you know?</font></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Felix pasted in the IRC
      log and waited while the other guy digested it. Van stood up and
      paced. His eyes were glazed over.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Van? Pal?”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to pee,” he
      said.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“No opening the
      door,” Felix said. “I saw an empty Mountain Dew bottle in the
      trash there.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right,” Van said.
      He walked like a zombie to the trash can and pulled out the empty
      magnum. He turned his back.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Monaco">&gt;
      I’m Felix</font></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Monaco">&gt;
      Will</font></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Felix’s stomach did a
      slow somersault as he thought about 2.0.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Felix, I think I
      need to go outside,” Van said. He was moving toward the airlock
      door. Felix dropped his keyboard and struggled to his feet and ran
      headlong to Van, tackling him before he reached the door.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Van,” he said,
      looking into his friend’s glazed, unfocused eyes. “Look at me,
      Van.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to go,” Van
      said. “I need to get home and feed the cats.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s something
      out there, something fast-acting and lethal. Maybe it will blow away
      with the wind. Maybe it’s already gone. But we’re going to sit
      here until we know for sure or until we have no choice. Sit down,
      Van. Sit.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m cold, Felix.”</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">It was freezing.
      Felix’s arms were broken out in gooseflesh and his feet felt like
      blocks of ice.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sit against the
      servers, by the vents. Get the exhaust heat.” He found a rack and
      nestled up against it.</p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Monaco">&gt;
      Are you there?</font></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Monaco">&gt;
      Still here—sorting out some logistics</font></p>
      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Monaco">&gt;

      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Monaco">&gt;

      <div>
        <p><u>Q1: What is the plot of the story?</u></p>
        Felix is a system administrator for Ardent who works at the Front Street data center. In the middle of one night, he receives a call that the servers at the data center are being targeted by a cyber attack, and he needs to go in person to the data center to resolve the issue, despite his wife Kelly’s irritation that he has junior sysadmins that report to him that could go in his place. At the data center, he finds his friend and coworker Van, as well as many other sysadmins that have come to address the unusually large-scale hack at the data center. Felix and Van are working to bring the servers back online when he receives a call from his wife Kelly who tells him that their baby boy Will has died, before the call is dropped. Van and Felix move to drive back to Felix’s home, but as they are about to leave the data center, they see the CN Tower, a large communications building in the city, come crashing down. At the same, they learn of a bioweapon that is sweeping through the city. Kelly convinces Van to abandon their earlier plan and instead bunker in the “cage”, a server room with high-quality air filters. While waiting there, they log on to an Internet messaging board and learn that various cities around the world have been attacked and are in disarray. While trying to process the situation and figure out what to do, Felix notices that there is a new attack on the servers, and he traces the attack to someone in the data center. He contacts the hacker and discovers it is another sysadmin who is similarly hiding out in the data center. Van suddenly tries to leave the server room, but Felix stops him.<br><br>

      <p><u>Q2: Who is Kelly and what happens to her in the story?</u></p>
      Kelly is Felix’s loving wife of five years. Together, they have a son named William but they nicknamed him “2.0”. When Felix is called into work by his employed Ardent in the middle of the night to address a cyber attack at the data center, Kelly is also awoken. As Felix drives to work, Kelly is still awake and calls him. Kelly is irritated that Felix still needs to do undesirable work despite being a manager at the company and having been at the company for seven years. She asks him to stop being on call overnight as she misses him when he leaves in the middle of the night. Felix promises to stop, before 2.0 vomits on Kelly and she hangs up the phone. Later in the night, as Felix is working to restore the Ardent servers, he receives a call from Kelly, but Kelly doesn’t say anything and the line quickly goes dead. She calls again later, crying as she tells Felix that 2.0 has died. She herself is extremely sick and throws up. She tries to tell Felix about the devastation unfolding and that she loves him before the call again drops. We later learn that the city has been attacked by a bioweapon, and presumably Kelly was affected and passed away.<br><br>

      <div>
      <p><u>Q2: Who is Van and what happens to him over the course of the story?</u></p>
      Van is a system administrator for Ardent. He has been friends with Felix for fifteen years, first having met him online and at various hobby conventions before eventually being hired by Felix to his current position. Van is tall, pony-tailed, and is interested in geek culture, like Star Wars and role-playing games. He has a background in electrical engineering and is extremely methodical.<br><br>
      When Felix shows up at the data center to address the cyberattack, Van is already there because his personal server was also brought down. He explains the situation to Felix, and the two work together throughout the night to bring the Ardent server back online. After a cryptic phone call from Felix’s wife Kelly, Felix tries to contact the police to check on her. Van sees this and offers to drive Felix back so that he can continue trying to contact Kelly as they head back. Just as the two are about to get on the elevator to leave, they see a large skyscraper outside collapse. At the same time, they learn about a potential virus sweeping the city, and Felix convinces Van to stay in the well-filtered server room. In the server room, the two access an Internet forum and learn that cities across the world are under attack. After an hour in the room, Van becomes panicked and tries to leave the room, claiming he needs to feed his cats. Felix stops him and the two continue waiting in the room.<br><br>

      <div>
      <p><u>Q4: Describe the setting of the story.</u></p>
      The story initially takes place in the home of the main character, Felix, who is called into work late one night. The primary setting of the story is Felix’s workplace, a multistory data center on Front Street, located in Toronto, Canada. Because the data center is critical to networks in Canada (95% of communications traffic in all of Canada depends on the servers in the building), its security is extremely strict: Felix needs to scan his eyes to even get inside the building. The core of the data center are rooms containing racks upon racks of servers. Accessing these server rooms requires passing another security precaution, a palm reader. <br><br>
      Because the servers require specific conditions to operate, the server rooms maintain a specific air pressure and cold room temperature. However, that night, because so many system administrators have been called to address an emergency, the server room is unusually warm. <br><br>
      The server racks are enclosed by small cages that allow enough room for a few technicians at a time to work on them. Getting inside a cage to access the servers directly requires two keys that must be turned simultaneously. When Felix learns of a bioweapon sweeping the city, while the other system administrator rush out of the building, he immediately decides to barricade himself and Van in the server room because it has high-quality air filters, backup generators, and an airlock. With only the two of them in the cage, it becomes extremely cold and the two curl up against the servers for heat.<br><br>

      <div>
      <p><u>Q5: What happens to the city of Toronto over the course of the story?</u></p>
      Toronto undergoes a multi-pronged attack. First, its communication networks are attacked by a sophisticated hack that brings down phone and Internet communications in the city. Felix, the main character, repeatedly tries to call his wife and the police, but the calls repeatedly fail to connect or are quickly dropped due to network errors. Second, the city is attacked by a bioweapon that causes its victims to vomit blood and quickly pass away. The city is placed under quarantine, so it is implied that the virus is highly contagious. Third, the CN Tower, the largest building in the city, is somehow destabilized and topples over, crashing down on the city’s financial district and crushing civilians. We learn that these attacks are not isolated to Toronto; many cities around the world have been devastated, including Washington, D.C., Hong Kong, and Paris.<br><br>
